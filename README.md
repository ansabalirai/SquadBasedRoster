# Squad Based Rosters

This mod is (in the current form) an extension of the squad manager and seeks to add some gameplay buffs for sticking with the same squad composition. It essentially seeks to reward the player for maintaining squads by way of generic stat buffs in tactical as well as some passive perks. Consult https://github.com/tracktwo/SquadBasedRoster/blob/master/README.md for an overview of the main design goals which served as inspiration for this project.


## Key features

- Squad manager functionality is integrated, since it is integral to keep track of soldier squad memberships and other information pertinent to the mod.
- Currently, a squad can be composed of a squad leader, up to 2 squad specialists and ordinary soldiers.
    - Currently, the squad leader can only be a faction hero. It is planned to allow officers to replace them for this role, but it is pending a proper officer mod release for WOTC
    - Squad specialists can be trained via GTS tube slots, which are unlocked as you obtain GTS squad size (infiltration modifiers in case of CI) upgrades. Specialists can get access to certain, faction specific perks once trained (which are configurable), but beyond that, just function as normal soliders with the caveat that they only get access to these abilities when deployed on a mission with the appropriate faction/squad leader.
- Squad leveling is governed by three main factors: Number of missions a squad deploys into, time since squad creation (roughly FL) and of course, the squad composition itself
    - TODO: Add more details on how this works...
